-   Talk with a mod before posting invite links
-   Before asking a question, check #faq
-   If possible, post a snippet of your code when describing your problem (use https://gist.github.com/ or https://pastebin.com/ for long code or multiple files)
-   Talking about leaks is allowed, but don't ask or post links or upload content
-   Avoid mass-mentioning moderators unless necessary (e.g. spam)
