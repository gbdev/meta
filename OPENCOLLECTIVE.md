# Open Collective

The gbdev and gbadev organisations are *informal* collectives of individuals. The [Open Source Collective](https://www.oscollective.org/) is our fiscal host, allowing us to receive money as donations and spend them.

All the transactions are tracked in our Open Collective pages: [gbdev]() and [gbadev]()
