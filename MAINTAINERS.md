### guidelines

For breaking changes, in project with more than 1 active maintainer:
- Get at least 2 review approvals on PR
- or 1 but at least wait 14 days for possible interventions of any other maintainer
	- if a core maintainer asks for more time, wait again for 14 days
- If there's an ongoing conversation/discussion on a major PR, let it continue. Don't abruptly merge unless there's a clear consensus among the core maintainers (and approvals)
